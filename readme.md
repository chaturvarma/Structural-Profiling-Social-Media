###  Leveraging Local Node Features for Structural Profiling

This project leverages machine learning techniques to explore and analyze the complex world of graph structures. Our primary objectives are:

- Link Prediction: Predict potential connections within the graph to uncover hidden relationships
- Influence Prediction: Estimate the influence of nodes within the network to identify key players and influencers
- Community Detection: Determine if two nodes belong to the same community, helping to uncover group structures and affiliations
- Clustering: Group nodes based on their local properties to reveal underlying patterns and structures within the graph
